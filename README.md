Using the Splay Tree data structure, we will create a tree with the IP addresses of devices connected to a specific network router embedded in its nodes. In our code, we connected 11 devices to the network router, so there is a common part in the IP address of all devices. Now, the router receives a specific packet from the network and forwards it to a specific device, so a lookup operation is used to find the correct IP address. To increase the speed of this process, we use a Splay-Tree for searching and inserting IP addresses. This is the fastest data structure for search operations. So, when multiple devices are connected, the router sends the packet to the specified IP address.
